# AP OP
Project for the Riot Games API Challenge 2.0.

This project is open source and was created for the Riot Games API Challenge 2.0 in about 15 days of hard work.

##Node.js
We used 2 Node.js scripts:

* The first one was to get matches data (Patch, Match Type, Champion ID, Items and Win/Loss), which separated the data into 10 files, one for each region. The data was stored in csv.
* The second one was to register the number of ocurrences of each item, in each patch(By Item) and in each champion for each patch(By Champion). The data was separated into 2 folders and 20 files, 2 for each region(By Champion and By Item).

##PHP
We did a website in PHP to show the stats for the stored data.

The website has 2 options of viewing the data:

* The first, "By Champion" shows the stats for the use of changed items, for the selected champion, in the selected region(or globally, option "ALL").
* The second, "By Item", shows the stats for the use of changed items by region(or globally, option "ALL").

We used [Bootstrap v3.3.5](http://getbootstrap.com/), [jQuery 2.1.4](http://jquery.com/) and [Tooltipster 3.0(jQuery plugin)](http://iamceege.github.io/tooltipster/).
