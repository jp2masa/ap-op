# AP OP
Project for the Riot Games API Challenge 2.0.

##Node.js
We used 2 Node.js scripts:
* The first one was to get matches data (Patch, Match Type, Champion ID, Items and Win/Loss), which separated the data into 10 files, one for each region. The data was stored in csv.
* The second one was to register the number of ocurrences of each item, in each patch(By Item) and in each champion for each patch(By Champion). The data was separated into 2 folders and 20 files, 2 for each region(By Champion and By Item).

##PHP
We did a website in PHP to show the stats for the stored data.
